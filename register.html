- Participants' system outputs

By submitting results to the FCG GenChal (shared task), you consent to the public release of your scores and system outputs at the GenChal-related conferences and workshops and in the associated proceedings and/or on the FCG GenChal web site, at the task organizers' discretion. Scores may include but are not limited to, automatic and manual quantitative judgments, qualitative judgments, and such other metrics as the task organizers see fit. You accept that your scores and system outputs may be used for academic or internal non-profit research. You accept that the ultimate decision of metric choice and score value is that of the FCG GenChal organizers. You further agree that the task organizers are under no obligation to release scores and that scores may be withheld if it is the FCG GenChal organizers' judgment that the submission was incomplete, erroneous, deceptive, or violated the letter or spirit of the competition's rules. Inclusion of submission's scores is not an endorsement of a team or individual's submission, system, or science. You further agree that your system may be named according to the team name provided at the time of submission, or to a suitable shorthand as determined by the task organizers. Wherever appropriate, academic citation for the sending group would be added (e.g. in a paper summarizing the task).
